## **Licences**
1.Licences are the permissions granted by an user to copy their codes , they have their own terms and conditions to follow and if failed to conduct the rule , the consumer may be sued.
2. **MIT Licence** - This license is both brief and straightforward , protecting you from all liability if malicious third parties use your codes. **Apache License**-This license gives developers patent rights for derivatives of your project's code and does not limit how they may distribute such creations. **BSD License**-This is highly permissive licenses to use and can ensure other developers will feel comfortable using your code without having to fork over any proceeds if they begin monetizing their own work. **GNU GPLv3**- GNU developed this well-known copyleft license to reinforce the project's goals of providing free software for everyone to enjoy.
3.The License picker is only available when you create a new project on GitHub. You can manually add a license using the browser. 
4.GitHub displays license information to help users get information about open source licenses and the projects that use them
